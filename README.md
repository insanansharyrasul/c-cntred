# C-Cntred

It's the same with [cntred](https://github.com/insanansharyrasul/cntred), even worse, this code is made by ChatGPT (I modified a little, and removed things I don't understand, like the error message, maybe that's bad?)

# Why is this different with cntred?

Well, it's now really centered, you don't need to scroll, because it's kind of locked. If you tried to scroll, it will crash.

# Build
Simply run this commands
```
gcc c-cntred.c -o c-cntred
./c-cntred "Your message here"
```
